# LearnToSolderBadge

Learn How to Solder Kit!  

This electronics kit is a great project for those people who want to learn how to solder or already know how to solder!  

The kit features a circuit board, components, and a lanyard so you can wear it around your neck when finished :)  

The circuit is known as an "Astable Multivibrator," which means that the Blue and Yellow LEDs will alternate flashing on and off.  The Green LED will turn on when the button is pressed.  The Red LED turns on when the power is on.
